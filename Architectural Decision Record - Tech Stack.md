# Proof of Concept program for ABC Limited's Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

This ADR will be documenting whatever decisions I make regarding the Tech stack of my proof of concept for the complaint management system. The decision on what technology i choose to use in the creation of my POC will be influenced by the options usability, design and whatever coding language the option uses. THe technology also must be able to be used to create and run a website (locally) as that is what the finished product for the POC would have been so that is what i will be creating for my proof of concept.
 
## Considered Options

* ASP.NET
* Django

## Decision Outcome

I have decided to go with ASP.NET, specifically ASP.NET core MVC, which uses C# as its backend language as i know C# quite well so learning how to utilise it within ASP.NET will be easy enough, especially compared to django as that uses Python as its backend which, while generally an easier language to use, i have very little experience with, especially when using it to create a website. ASP.NEt is also favourable over Django as i can use visual studio, which is my preferred IDE, to create my project whereas Django would require me to use pycharm which is not quite as good.

### Confirmation

I have chosen ASP.NET as my technology.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
### ASP.NET
#### Pros
* Uses C# which i have a good amount of experience with so it will be easy to adapt
* will allow me to use Visual Studio
* WIll learn something new in ASP.NEt webdev
* Can utilise Identity to create the login/ register pages
### Cons
* will take time to learn how to use ASP.NET
### Django
#### Pros
* i got nothing here
#### Cons
* uses Python
* uses pycharm
